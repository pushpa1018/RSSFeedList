I have created a single web page which consumes this feed [1] and presents it as
an attractive list of well-formatted feed entries, including item
metadata. When the user clicks on a particular feed
entry in the list, they are presented with a "detail view" for
that entry including more complete metadata. 

I have used only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for this exercise.
